# BiliCDN_TW v2.1.0 test report

## Automated scope

Baseline: published v2.0.4 commit `363d527136c876a162d06c78d77e8663ce2a62cc`. New tests first reproduced first-Catalog cold selection, unattributed first-request rewrite, abort-triggered probing, missing no-failure startup rescue and missing bounded deadline; runtime was then changed.

The source-level suite has 206 passing assertions. New contracts cover legal original pass-through before preflight, exact signed backup versus synthesized Catalog URL, measured Catalog victory, low-confidence original fallback, a shared three-second deadline with hanging probes, previously aborted requests starting no probe, current-stream 16 KiB Catalog compatibility, stream-scoped Catalog 403 exclusion, strict blacklist admission, actual Fetch/XHR native dispatch after the gate, XHR abort and explicit-timeout semantics, sequential fair challengers, 15-second no-progress fallback and a single first-start core reload. Existing restriction, Native group isolation, host-lock, disabled, Fetch single-reader/cancel, XHR and incident tests remain included.

Verification commands and reproducible build/checksums are recorded by `npm run verify` and the packaged build manifest. This report does not equate source-level fake transport/player contracts with real Chrome playback. No Code Security scan was run.

## Real Chrome / Tampermonkey

Pending publication and user update, per the requested order. In an additional test tab, compare the first browser media request's true dispatch time and target/response hosts with the preflight's three-second window and result; then check automatic quality, seek, SPA, background return, 2x as a user selection and no healthy-probe-induced switch. A naturally occurring 6006 or dead core is not claimed to have been reproduced in Chrome.

Unsupported entries—including synchronous XHR, XHR with an explicit finite timeout, unknown/unmatched media, Worker-initiated media and URL shapes that cannot be safely rewritten—are not held by preflight; diagnosis must mark them as such. A probe predicts only the sampled URL and interval, not later CDN availability.

# Historical v2.0.4 test report

## Current release

Immutable predecessor: v2.0.3 commit `28b1cf57a3c3eaeafc30c282f9f5ec67a8406c0a`, userscript SHA-256 `667476a1a8b04c75437410c35ac15b5d52f568682d7d3934f55e22650507a19d`.

Before changing runtime logic, the new source-level test failed because a default-unavailable Catalog media URL with `os=mcdn` passed unchanged. A separate no-file controller reproduction showed that an audio-blacklisted host remained eligible for ungrouped media. The previous control-center button stored user blacklists as video-only; a regression reproducing an existing stored row failed for audio before the compatibility fix.

The functional suite now has 166 passing assertions. New contracts cover default-unavailable PCDN/live/resource pass-through, unrestricted live preservation, blocked playurl primary/backup, user-wide black against matched audio, ungrouped audio-black eligibility, black/dead special-media rejection, native Fetch/XHR refusal and enable-between-XHR-open/send revalidation. Existing video/audio recovery, Native exact URL, host-lock, disabled mode, cancellation and single-reader tests remain included.

Automated verification passed on 2026-09-22: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run architecture`, `npm test` (166 assertions) and `npm run verify` (deterministic double build, JavaScript syntax, v2 bundle invariants, package equality and checksums). No Code Security scan.

Real Chrome/Tampermonkey v2.0.4 acceptance: pending publication and user update. No current-version playback or absence of black-screen regression is claimed. A userscript cannot retroactively prevent a browser redirect or intercept media initiated outside its playurl and page Fetch/XHR paths; if Bilibili issues those requests, browser network initiator evidence is needed to evaluate coverage.

# Historical v2.0.3 test report

## Current release

Immutable predecessor: v2.0.2 commit `7739d5ada141d4d35192dc6ae06693ace25f7d13`, script SHA-256 `d36b1271af5107b14c3820d7afc55ea56ba0ec0f307643b2b1c2471792745ea8`.

The installed v2.0.2 report showed repeated zero-byte Catalog aborts followed by successful Akamai fallbacks in multiple groups. This does not establish why the browser aborted. The same report had playing media but stale pause-armed recovery state.

Before changing runtime logic, separate source-level contracts failed for (1) a new quality retaining its cold Catalog plan after observed Native affinity, and (2) healthy short resume retaining pause-armed. Both now pass.

The suite has 148 passing assertions. Additional checks cover different-quality exact Native URL, no fabricated observed affinity, missing Native capability, explicit fixed mode, and a newly blacklisted affinity host. Existing v2.0.2 restriction, backup, responseHost, incident, playback-rate and cancellation tests remain included.

Passed on 2026-09-21: `npm run verify` completed types, architecture, all 148 assertions, deterministic double build, syntax, package equality and checksums. No Code Security or independent security suite.

Chrome/Tampermonkey acceptance of v2.0.3 is pending user installation. The supplied v2.0.2 report is user runtime evidence, not a v2.0.3 real-browser test. No natural dead-core reproduction is required for publication. Historical black-screen causes remain unconfirmed. See `docs/POST_RELEASE_v2.0.2.md` for the evidence trail.

Deliverables: `Release/v2.0.3/` script, changelog, report, manifest, SHA-256; GitHub Release attaches only the script. No previous release directory is overwritten.

# Historical v2.0.2 verification (unchanged scope)

## Baseline and evidence

Immutable baseline: v2.0.1 commit `66f7c36dd3605933342ec0536892753f5bfe8cca`, userscript SHA-256 `ec2be1e39cea70ddfb04241b26b23b7f787d63896bea100bcb5e12cc8d3ef279`.

The submitted report establishes an uninitialized video core and no reload, not a proven connection to prohibited cosov. Recorded successful video was rewritten to mirrorali; the last video terminal was an abort. The root cause of the historical black screen remains unconfirmed.

## Reproductions and functional verification

Before runtime fixes, new assertions reproduced: empty response URL inventing a host, prohibited original retained in playurl backups, a player backup rewritten to primary, paused dead core failing to create an incident, and a challenger selecting default-unavailable cosov.

The complete source-level functional suite now has 140 passing assertions, including:

- Existing evidence/ranking, limits, cancellation, XHR JSON, disabled behavior, rate preservation, core restore and safe measurement contracts.
- Default-unavailable output removal; independent black/dead cases against cached fallback, fixed CDN and playurl output.
- Native XHR open target; restriction added between open and send; single native send; no-alternative XHR/Fetch local blocking; disabled original pass-through.
- Permitted Catalog backup adoption and subsequent group affinity plan; weak query match cannot claim backup role.
- Exact Native audio backup, video-affinity isolation, invalid Native exclusion on request/output and generation cleanup.
- Host-lock cannot restore a dead root; no-alternative player output contains neither prohibited primary nor backups.
- Missing response URL stays null; target-host network failure still opens the appropriate circuit; latest abort does not erase last successful video observation.
- Sustained dead paused core captures evidence without reload; timer gaps and initial startup do not falsely count as continuous prior-healthy death.
- First paused-tick play observer, original return preservation, untrusted calls rejected, trusted long-pause intent while paused, one reload, reset restores owned method.
- Late manual mark and 1,000 subsequent successes preserve the frozen core incident; 128 KiB recorder and 96 KiB report checks.

These are source-level fake-player/transport contracts, not real Chrome playback. Passing assertions are not claimed to exhaust all browser-specific URL or player lifecycle variants.

## Release verification

Passed on 2026-09-21: `npm run verify` completed all 140 assertions, strict types, architecture, deterministic build, syntax, bundle/package and checksum checks with Node 26.8.1, TypeScript 7.0.2 and esbuild 0.28.2.

Run `npm run verify` for strict TypeScript, architecture/cycles, all functional assertions, deterministic double build, JavaScript syntax, bundle invariants, package equality and SHA-256. The release checksum list is authoritative. No Code Security scan or independent security suite is run.

## Real Chrome / Tampermonkey: pending after installation

Per user instruction, publish first, then perform targeted acceptance after the user updates. No preserved failed/paused tab was operated during this code repair. No v2.0.2 Chrome pass is claimed here.

Use an additional tab: compare native outbound/response hosts with the report; check legal backup behavior, prohibited-host absence, fixed/automatic mode, user-selected speed, one seek/quality/SPA/background-return sequence, and incident marking. Natural dead-core reproduction is not a publication gate. Do not infer consumed media or a black-screen cause solely from a route plan or host label.

## Deliverables

`Release/v2.0.2/`: userscript, CHANGELOG, TEST_REPORT, manifest and SHA-256 list. GitHub Release attaches only `BiliCDN_TW.user.js`. Existing v2 storage is preserved; no history patches, CI, remote code or telemetry are added.
